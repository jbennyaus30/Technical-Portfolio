1.1 Business Concept<br>
Chic Styles Boutique is a small fashion store based in Australia. It specializes in Resort-style clothing and accessories for women aged 30–40 who love simple yet chic designs. The boutique offers a carefully curated selection of high-quality items, mainly in black and white, with prices ranging from AUD 80–120. The collection is intentionally small to maintain exclusivity and focus on elegant styles.<br><br>
